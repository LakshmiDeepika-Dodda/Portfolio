                I'm a developer with a strong foundation in both <code className=" text-white">frontend </code>
                and <code className=" text-white">backend</code> technologies,
                passionate about building clean, accessible, and user-friendly web applications.
                My work blends thoughtful design with robust engineering—creating user interfaces
                that are not only visually appealing but also performant across devices and compliant
                with modern accessibility standards.
            </p>
            <p className="indent-4 py-4 md:indent-8 ...">
                I hold a <code className=" text-white">Master’s degree</code> in Mobile Application Development and have hands-on experience with
                technologies like <code className=" text-white">ReactJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, Node.js,
                </code>and <code className=" text-white">REST APIs</code>. I enjoy transforming complex requirements into elegant, maintainable code and believe that
                collaboration, code quality, and continuous learning are key to building great software.
            </p>
            <p className="indent-4 py-4 md:indent-8 ...">
                Throughout my journey, I've developed responsive applications in a range of environments—from startups
                to corporate teams. I thrive in agile settings and enjoy contributing to projects
                where application performance, scalability, and inclusive design go hand in hand.
                Currently, I’m actively enhancing my skills in Web development, TypeScript. I am fluent
                in <code className=" text-white">English</code> and completed <code className=" text-white">B1 German certification</code> and preparing for the B2 level in German
                to better integrate into international teams.

                Outside of work, I love watching crime thriller movies, meeting up with friends, and playing badminton.
                I have a deep appreciation for nature and enjoy traveling and backpacking to discover new places and cultures.
